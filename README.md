# pbrtest

A small testbed for physically based rendering experiments.

At the moment, this repository mostly consists of code derived from the PBR chapters of [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/). It also contains an asset from the [sIBL Archive](http://www.hdrlabs.com/sibl/archive.html). At some point I'll probably clean this up and merge it into one of my larger repositories.
